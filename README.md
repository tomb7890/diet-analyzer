Diet-Analyzer
==============================

 Diet-Analyzer is a Rails web application for analyzing and tracking nutrition data.
Foods are easily found and added by using the "Add serving" search tool. A dynamic nutrition preview is presented as search results are browsed; full nutrition information is shown in the nutrition tabs once a food is saved as part of daily food log.
